# Phase 4: Temporal Workflows - Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide walks through testing the complete end-to-end event-driven payment processing system with Temporal workflow orchestration.

## Architecture Flow

```
Payment API Request
    â†“
NestJS App (publishes to SNS)
    â†“
SNS Topic (payment-events)
    â”œâ†’ SQS: payment-processing-queue â†’ Lambda: payment-processor â†’ Temporal Workflow
    â”œâ†’ SQS: payment-webhook-queue â†’ Lambda: webhook-sender
    â”œâ†’ SQS: payment-analytics-queue (future)
    â””â†’ SQS: payment-notification-queue (future)

Temporal Workflow Execution:
    â†“
Temporal Server
    â†“
Temporal Worker (polls for tasks)
    â†“
Activities (validation, processing, webhooks, compensation)
```

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup

Copy the environment template and update feature flags:
```bash
cp env.local.template .env
```

Update these values in `.env`:
```bash
PORT=3001                          # Changed from 3000
ENABLE_SNS_PUBLISHING=true         # Use SNS pub/sub
ENABLE_SQS_CONSUMER=false          # Disable old cron consumer
ENABLE_TEMPORAL_WORKFLOWS=true     # Enable workflows
ENABLE_LAMBDA_PROCESSING=true      # Enable Lambda triggers
```

### 2. Services Running

Ensure all Docker services are healthy:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

Expected services:
- âœ… `payment_postgres` (PostgreSQL on port 5433)
- âœ… `payment-localstack` (LocalStack on port 4566)
- âœ… `payment_temporal` (Temporal server on port 7233)
- âœ… `payment_temporal_ui` (Temporal UI on port 8088)

### 3. LocalStack Resources

Initialize AWS resources in LocalStack:
```bash
bash scripts/localstack-setup.sh
```

Expected output:
- âœ… SNS Topic: `payment-events`
- âœ… SQS Queues: 5 queues + 1 DLQ
- âœ… Subscriptions: All queues subscribed to SNS topic

### 4. Deploy Lambda Functions

Build and deploy Lambdas to LocalStack:
```bash
bash scripts/build-lambdas.sh
bash scripts/deploy-lambdas.sh
```

Expected Lambdas:
- âœ… `payment-processor` (triggered by `payment-processing-queue`)
- âœ… `webhook-sender` (triggered by `payment-webhook-queue`)

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Start the Temporal Worker

In a **new terminal**, start the Temporal worker:
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Documents/payment-system-assessment
npm run start:worker
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[TemporalWorker] Starting Temporal Worker...
[TemporalWorker] Temporal Worker started successfully
[TemporalWorker] Task Queue: payment-processing
[TemporalWorker] Namespace: default
```

**Keep this terminal running** - the worker must be active to execute workflows.

### Step 2: Start the NestJS Application

In **another terminal**, start the NestJS app (it should already be running from npm run start:dev):
```bash
cd /Users/victor/Documents/payment-system-assessment
npm run start:dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[Nest] [SnsService] SNS client initialized successfully
[Nest] [SnsService] Topic ARN: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:000000000000:payment-events
[Nest] [TemporalClientService] Temporal client initialized successfully
[Nest] [TemporalClientService] Address: localhost:7233
[Nest] Application is running on: http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 3: Initialize a Payment

Create a payment via API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/payments/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-merchant-api-key-123" \
  -d '{
    "merchantId": "merchant-1",
    "paymentMethodId": "pm-card-1",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "USD",
    "reference": "ORDER-2024-12345",
    "description": "Test payment for workflow",
    "metadata": {
      "orderId": "12345",
      "customerId": "CUST-001"
    }
  }'
```

### Step 4: Observe the Event Flow

#### 4.1 NestJS App Logs (Terminal 1)
Watch for SNS publication:
```
[PaymentsService] âœ“ Event published to SNS: payment.initiated
```

#### 4.2 Lambda Processor Logs
Check LocalStack Lambda logs:
```bash
docker logs payment-localstack 2>&1 | grep -A 10 "PaymentProcessor"
```

Expected:
```
[PaymentProcessor] Received 1 messages from SQS
[PaymentProcessor] ðŸš€ PAYMENT INITIATED
[PaymentProcessor] âœ… Temporal workflow started
```

#### 4.3 Temporal Worker Logs (Terminal 2)
Watch for workflow execution:
```
[PaymentActivity] Validating payment: <paymentId>
[PaymentActivity] Payment validated successfully
[PaymentActivity] Processing payment with gateway
[PaymentActivity] Payment processed successfully
[PaymentActivity] Updating payment status: completed
[PaymentActivity] Sending webhook for payment
[PaymentActivity] Webhook delivered successfully
```

#### 4.4 Temporal UI
Open http://localhost:8088 in your browser.

Navigate to:
- **Workflows** â†’ You should see `payment-<paymentId>-<timestamp>`
- Click on the workflow to see:
  - Timeline of activities
  - Input/output of each activity
  - Current status
  - Event history

### Step 5: Query Workflow Status

Query the running workflow (replace `WORKFLOW_ID` with actual ID from logs):
```bash
# This would be done via Temporal CLI or API
# For now, use the Temporal UI at http://localhost:8088
```

### Step 6: Test Failure Scenarios

#### 6.1 Invalid Payment (Should Trigger Compensation)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/payments/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: test-merchant-api-key-123" \
  -d '{
    "merchantId": "merchant-1",
    "paymentMethodId": "pm-card-1",
    "amount": -100,
    "currency": "USD",
    "reference": "ORDER-INVALID",
    "description": "Invalid amount test"
  }'
```

**Expected in Temporal Worker:**
```
[PaymentActivity] Validating payment
[PaymentActivity] Payment amount must be greater than zero
[PaymentActivity] Compensating payment - Reason: Payment amount must be greater than zero
[PaymentActivity] Payment status updated: failed
```

## Verification Checklist

### âœ… SNS â†’ SQS Fan-out
- [ ] Payment event published to SNS topic
- [ ] Multiple SQS queues receive the message
- [ ] Each Lambda triggered by its respective queue

### âœ… Lambda Processing
- [ ] `payment-processor` Lambda invoked automatically
- [ ] Lambda logs show successful message processing
- [ ] Lambda starts Temporal workflow

### âœ… Temporal Workflow Execution
- [ ] Workflow appears in Temporal UI
- [ ] All activities execute in correct order:
  1. validatePayment
  2. updatePaymentStatus (processing)
  3. processPaymentWithGateway
  4. updatePaymentStatus (completed)
  5. sendWebhookNotification
- [ ] Workflow shows "Completed" status

### âœ… Fault Tolerance
- [ ] Invalid payments trigger compensation
- [ ] Failed activities retry automatically (check Temporal UI)
- [ ] Workflow maintains state through retries

### âœ… Observability
- [ ] Logs show correlation IDs
- [ ] Temporal UI displays complete workflow history
- [ ] Can query workflow status in real-time

## Troubleshooting

### Temporal Worker Not Connecting
```bash
# Check Temporal server health
docker logs payment_temporal

# Ensure worker has correct TEMPORAL_ADDRESS
echo $TEMPORAL_ADDRESS  # Should be localhost:7233
```

### Lambda Not Triggering
```bash
# Check event source mappings
docker run --rm \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test \
  amazon/aws-cli \
  --endpoint-url=http://host.docker.internal:4566 \
  lambda list-event-source-mappings
```

### SNS Messages Not Reaching SQS
```bash
# Check SNS subscriptions
docker run --rm \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=test \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=test \
  amazon/aws-cli \
  --endpoint-url=http://host.docker.internal:4566 \
  sns list-subscriptions
```

### Workflow Not Starting
- Ensure `ENABLE_TEMPORAL_WORKFLOWS=true` in `.env`
- Verify Temporal client logs on NestJS startup
- Check Lambda logs for "Temporal workflow started" message

## Advanced Testing

### Test Concurrent Workflows
```bash
# Run multiple payments simultaneously
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v1/payments/initialize \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "X-API-Key: test-merchant-api-key-123" \
    -d "{
      \"merchantId\": \"merchant-1\",
      \"paymentMethodId\": \"pm-card-1\",
      \"amount\": $((100 + i * 10)),
      \"currency\": \"USD\",
      \"reference\": \"ORDER-$i\",
      \"description\": \"Concurrent test $i\"
    }" &
done
wait
```

Check Temporal UI for 5 concurrent workflows.

### Test Workflow Signals (Future)
```bash
# Cancel a running workflow (requires implementation)
# temporal workflow signal --workflow-id <WORKFLOW_ID> --name cancelPayment
```

## Success Criteria

Phase 4 is complete when:
1. âœ… Payment request â†’ SNS â†’ SQS â†’ Lambda â†’ Temporal workflow (full flow works)
2. âœ… Temporal Worker executes all activities successfully
3. âœ… Invalid payments trigger compensation logic
4. âœ… Workflow state visible in Temporal UI
5. âœ… No errors in any service logs
6. âœ… Old SQS consumer disabled (no "QueueDoesNotExist" errors)

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements:
- Integrate real payment gateway in activities
- Add database persistence in activities
- Implement webhook retry with exponential backoff
- Add Temporal workflow versioning
- Set up Temporal Cloud for production
- Add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- Implement saga compensation for complex scenarios
